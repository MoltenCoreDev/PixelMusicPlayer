# Pixel Music Player
Little godot-made mp3 file player!

# Features
- Sorting by album / artist
- Looping
- Play Queue

# Why?
I believe linux is lacking a solid local music player, i decided to try and change that.

As you can probably suspect halfway there i realized i picked the wrong tool for the job, godot doesn't have a lot of things i would need to create such a player.


## That's why i'm marking this project as finished, it's a Proof Of Concept more than a music player.
I will fix any crashes that may occur, but don't plan on expanding this project way more than it's current state.
Builds should be provided anytime soon.
